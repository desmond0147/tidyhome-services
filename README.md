Testing
I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari.

I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good, and functions on all standard screen sizes using devtools device toolbar. I confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, services, and contact text are all readable and easy to understand.

I have confirmed that the form works: it requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, and the submit button works.

Bugs
Solved Bugs
I found that with the contact us form, after submitting the form the footer was floating. After the first project Slack call with my mentor to know why my footer was floating, I searched Google and YouTube videos. I found that I had to add the following CSS reset: 
/* Reset default styles (wildcard) */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Add box-sizing reset */
}. When i run it again the footer was fixed.
